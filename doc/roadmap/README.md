## Roadmap
- Web Scrapping
- Data ETL
    - [x] Take company name, fortune 500 rank, sampled date & rating data
    - (de-prioritized) Do you want to store fortune 500 ranking? Where do you want to store it? `CompanyRating` might be a good place.
    - [x] Database manager's `create()` has to return id of the object created. This is important for setting up one-to-many fields.
    - (optional: other company data specified in database schema)
- Database & Cache
    - **Cache webpage**
        - [x] Store url-filename pairs in database
        - [x] When selenium navigate_to is called, check if the url is in db
