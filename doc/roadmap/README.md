## Roadmap
- Web Scrapping
- Data ETL
    - [x] Take company name, fortune 500 rank, sampled date & rating data
    - (de-prioritized) Do you want to store fortune 500 ranking? Where do you want to store it? `CompanyRating` might be a good place.
    - [x] Database manager's `create()` has to return id of the object created. This is important for setting up one-to-many fields.
    - (optional: other company data specified in database schema)
- Database & Cache
    - **Cache webpage**
        - [x] Store url-filename pairs in database
        - [x] When selenium navigate_to is called, check if the url is in db
    - [x] Store data in database using database manager class.
    - [x] (optional: store web page in database)
    - [x] Scrap at least multiple companies in database.
    - üî•Scrap all 500 companies in database. Particularlyy look at `batch_scrap_company_data()` and how to test it.
        - [ ] The fortune 500 uses Ajax for the rest of the company list. We have to use ways like scroll in selenium in order to get the entire list.
            - We need to do this several phases: 1) get url ... wait page finish loading 2) scroll down 3) wait 2 sec 4) expect spinner 
            - 5) if got spinner, then "wait till it's gone", then wait .5~1 more sec 6) compare if currentCompanyList.len < pageCompanyList.len, then keep loading more, loop and repeat 2) - 5)
                - if company list did not grow, end #
            - 6) if no spinner, <we might wait once again>, or we see this as end & no more Ajax. #
                - if company list grow, however, then repeat again from 2)
        - [ ] (optional) speed up selenium by not waiting till page load entirely. Use `none` and wait for target element instead.
- Flask app
    - `/`: home page
    - `/companies/`: master view
    - `/companies/<int: id>`: detail view
- Writing Test cases
    - [x] Test scrapping functionality
    - [ ] üî•Test routes

- Wrap up
    - [ ] ‚û°Ô∏è Distinguish `SI507project.py` & `flask_server.py`, and give how to explanation in readme.
    - [ ] Ô∏èÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è Checkpoint: see what's TODO in "Code Requirements for Grading". Then redefine.
